I'm going to provide a brief overview of my journey to functional programming, and my rationale behind picking Clojure as my language of choice.
I will briefly talk about my perceived advantages and disadvantages of using Clojure.

I'll try to briefly and gently show core Clojure concepts, and then we'll implement a rudimentary event sourcing engine using Clojure.

The engine will borrow heavily from Redux so that participants have a common ground from which to build their understanding of what we're doing.

Lastly, we'll run it on Node!

I suspect I'll need approximately 30 minutes of talk time.

===============
My journey to functional programming in ClojureScript

(Show disposisition to JavaScript slide)
Talk about how you got into JavaScript
Talk about how dangerous state is
When you get to the Entelect stuff, talk about React, Webpack, JSinSA, JoziJS, Kenneth, emacs, ramda, and Redux.
